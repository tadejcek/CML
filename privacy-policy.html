            <h3>The right to limit processing</h3>
            <p>You have the right to require that Comland restrict the processing of your personal data subject to one
                of
                the following cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You dispute the accuracy of the data for the period which enables the controller to verify the
                    accuracy of your personal data,</li>
                <li>The processing is unlawful, and you oppose the deletion of personal data, and instead ask for
                    restrictions on their use,</li>
                <li>Comland no longer needs personal data for the purposes of the processing, but you need them for the

                    of the controller outweigh your reasons.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The right to data portability</h3>
            <p>You have the right to receive personal data relating to you in possession of Comland in a structured,

                used and machine-readable form, and the right to forward such information to another controller, without
                Comland  for whom the data was provided, hampering you, where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Processing is based on your consent or agreement and</li>
                <li>Processing is carried out by automated means.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The right to object</h3>
            <p>On grounds related to your particular situation, you have the right, at any time, to object to the
                processing of personal data if this is based on the legitimate interests pursued by Comland d.o.o. or a
                third party Comland will cease to process personal data, unless it proves compelling reasons for
                processing
                that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of
                legal
                claims. Where personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right, at any
                time, to
                object to the processing of your personal data for such marketing purposes, including profiling, if it
                is
                associated with such direct marketing. Where direct marketing is based on consent, the right of reply
                can be
                made by cancelling the given personal consent.</p>
            <h3>Procedure for asserting your rights</h3>
            <p>All the above-mentioned requirements which relate to the exercise of rights in connection with your
                personal
                data may be addressed in writing to the controller by using the contact addresses for personal data
                protection. If you submit your request in accordance with the above paragraph by electronic means, the
                information, to the extent possible, will be provided to you by electronic means, unless you request
                otherwise.</p>

            <p>For the purposes of reliable identification in the event of exercising your rights with respect to
                personal
                information, the controller may request additional information from you needed to confirm your identity;
                it
                may refuse to act in accordance with this chapter only in the event that it proves that you cannot be
                reliably identified.</p>

            <p>The request by which you exercise your rights in relation to your personal data will be responded without
                undue delay and no later than one month from receipt of the request. Comland may extend the limit for
                exercising the rights for up to two additional months, considering the complexity and the number of
                requests. Where Comland extends the deadline, you will be notified of any such extension within one
                month of
                receipt of the request together with the reasons for the delay.</p>

            <p>Where, in accordance with this chapter, your requests are manifestly unfounded or exaggerated, especially
                since they are repeated, Comland may:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Charge a reasonable fee, taking into account administrative costs of the provision of information or
                    messages or performing the required action,</li>
                <li>Dismiss action concerning the request.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The right to lodge complaints with regard to the processing of personal data</h3>
            <p>Any complaint with regard to the processing of your personal data may be directed to the contact
                addresses
                for personal data protection.</p>

            <p>You have the right to lodge a complaint directly with the Information Commissioner if you think that the
                processing of personal data relating to you violates Slovenian rules or regulations of the European
                Union in
                the field of personal data protection.</p>
            <h3>Authorised person</h3>

            </p>
            <h3>Rights of data subjects</h3>
            <p>You can submit request (for Access, Rectification, Erasure and Withdrawal of Personal Consent,
                Restriction
                of Processing and Objection to Processing) in person or as a certified document by a notary or an
                administrative unit serving as proof that the right person is exercising their right. Protection of
                personal
                data against unauthorised consultation and ensuring personal data accuracy are among key objectives of
                the
                GDPR, therefore data subjects must accept Comland’s requirement for identification. Otherwise anyone
                could
                request a copy or a rectification of anyone’s personal data, and this could lead to unauthorised
                disclosure
                or use of incorrect personal data.</p>

            <p>In cases where data subjects give consent following a request by electronic means, the withdrawal of such
                a
                consent shall be possible, and the identity of such data subjects shall be verified using e-mail
                confirmation.</p>

            <p>We shall address each request submitted by data subjects and carry out appropriate procedures or notify
                data
                subjects that this is not possible and state the reason why.</p>
            <h3>Security measures</h3>
            <p>Comland uses technical and organizational security precautions to protect data from manipulation, loss,
                destruction or access by unauthorized persons. To ensure the security and confidentiality of personal
                data
                that we collect on-line, we use data networks that are among other things protected also by industry
                standard firewall and password. In the course of handling personal data, we take measures reasonably
                designed to protect that information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or
                destruction. While we cannot guarantee against any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure,
                alteration
                or destruction of data, we endeavour to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.</p>
